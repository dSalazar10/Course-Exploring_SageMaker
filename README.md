Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Course 6 - Deploy a Model

This is a repo for hosting my CloudFormation code. It can be used to deploy the necessary resources to build, train, test, and deploy a Machine Learning model.
On top of that, the tutorial also provides a simple front end for accessing the AWS API Gateway.

I only made this to further my DevOps education. Its a DevOps version of what they want you to do in the course.
